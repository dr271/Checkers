A Java implementation of checkers complete with GUI and AI controlled oponent of varying difficulty levels through the use of minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

To build and run the program I would reccomend loading the ISTCheckers file up in an IDE of your choice (I used NetBeans) and run it from there.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
